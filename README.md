# JavaScriptHomework
Let’s keep applying the Git collaboration skills we’re learning.  In this project, we’ll be using Git to write comments on your student’s JavaScript homework. Don’t worry! You don’t need to know JavaScript to do the project.  If the code below piques your interest, check out Codecademy’s JavaScript course here.
